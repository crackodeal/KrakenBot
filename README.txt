#A Simple Cryptocurrency Trading Bot and Excel Interface
Developed for educational purposes, this project served as my introduction to the world of cryptocurrency and trading.

#Main Functions
1. Command Line Trading (2018):

- The bot was a command-line process that automatically traded cryptocurrencies in my Kraken.com portfolio.
- It utilized arbitrage trading, capitalizing on price discrepancies between cryptocurrency values in EUR and USD. For example, buying cryptocurrency with EUR and quickly selling it for USD generated small profits.
- Over time, I identified flaws in my approach and exited the market based on a stop-loss condition. Despite this, the bot served well as an educational project.

2. Excel Integration (2020):

- The bot enabled Buy/Sell orders directly from Excel.
- Trading decisions were made manually, but buy/sell orders were executed directly from my Excel crypto portfolio, synchronized with Kraken.com.
