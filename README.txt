A simple crypto currency trading bot and Excel interface.
Developed for self educational purpose. Introduction to crypto currency and trading world.

It used to have two main functions:

1. In year 2018 it was a command line process which automatically traded crypto currencies in my Kraken.com portfolio. 
It used arbitrage trading. Simply saying it used a lag in pricing of crypto currency to EUR and USD. For example,
buying crypto by EUR and quickly selling to USD gave me a little profit. With a time I found breaches in my approach
and exited the market on stop loss condition. However this bot served well as an educational project.

2. In enables Buy/Sell orders from Excel in year 2020. Thus trading is done by a decision but sell/buy orders initiated 
straight from my Excel crypto portfolio, synchronised with Kraken.com


ABANDONED project. 
No commits, builds or testing since year 2020.
Do not bother using my Kraken API keys. They have already been revoked.
